# S5 Dual PDM Microphone to USB

This a fork of the 'pico-USB-microphone' project, which has been adapted to:

- Operate at a clock speed of 768kHz, and correct the decimation by lowering the sampling rate from 16kHz to 12kHz (as decimations lower than 64 are not supported by OpenPDMtoPCM)
- Operate two microphones simultaneously in master-mode.
- Adapt the USB descriptors to advertise a stereo device operating at 12kHz sampling rate.
- Implement I2C to drive the Control PCBA's LED via the IO expander, provision for button presses also included.

This version requires a heavily modified S5.

The main code is stored in /examples/usb_microphone. The pin assignments are now:

| Raspberry Pi Pico / RP2040 | Peripheral Function |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 3.3V | VCC |
| GND | GND |
| GPIO 2 | DAT_L |
| GPIO 3 | CLK_L |
| GPIO 4 | DAT_R |
| GPIO 5 | CLK_R |
| GPIO 26 | SDA |
| GPIO 27 | SCL |

For reference, the original repo's readme has been preserved below.

# Microphone Library for Pico

Capture audio from a microphone on your [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) or any [RP2040](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/rp2040/) based board. ðŸŽ¤

## Examples

See [examples](examples/) folder.


## Cloning

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArmDeveloperEcosystem/microphone-library-for-pico.git 
```

## Building

1. [Set up the Pico C/C++ SDK](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)
2. Set `PICO_SDK_PATH`
```sh
export PICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk
```
3. Create `build` dir, run `cmake` and `make`:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DPICO_BOARD=pico
make
```
4. Copy example `.uf2` to Pico when in BOOT mode.

The [OpenPDM2PCM](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/code/X_NUCLEO_CCA02M1//file/53f8b511f2a1/Middlewares/OpenPDM2PCM/) library is used to filter raw PDM data into PCM. The [TinyUSB](https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb) library is used in the `usb_microphone` example.
